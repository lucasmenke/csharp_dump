# API for Authentication & Authorization with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Refresh Tokens & Roles

In this project I will create a page for user to create an account and save them in a database using hash & salt. Furthermore registerd users are able to log back in. In addition to that I will use JWT & Refresh Tokens. A registerd user can get a role and based on this role the user will be able to call specific API endpoints.
